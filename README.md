## Installing stamp

To install stamp, run
```bash
# We recommend using a virtual environment to install stamp
python -m venv .venv
. .venv/bin/activate

pip install "git+https://github.com/KatherLab/stamp@v2[all]"
```

If the installation was successful, running `stamp` in your terminal should yield the following output:

```
$ stamp
usage: stamp [-h] [--config CONFIG_FILE_PATH] {init,setup,preprocess,train,crossval,deploy,statistics,config,heatmaps} ...

STAMP: Solid Tumor Associative Modeling in Pathology

positional arguments:
  {init,setup,preprocess,train,crossval,deploy,statistics,config,heatmaps}
    init                Create a new STAMP configuration file at the path specified by --config
    preprocess          Preprocess whole-slide images into feature vectors
    train               Train a Vision Transformer model
    crossval            Train a Vision Transformer model with cross validation
    deploy              Deploy a trained Vision Transformer model
    statistics          Generate AUROCs and AUPRCs with 95%CI for a trained Vision Transformer model
    config              Print the loaded configuration
    heatmaps            Generate heatmaps for a trained model

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --config CONFIG_FILE_PATH, -c CONFIG_FILE_PATH
                        Path to config file. Default: config.yaml
```
